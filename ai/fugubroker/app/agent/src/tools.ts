/**
 * Read-only chain tools exposed to this agent's LLM (AI SDK `tool` wrap).
 *
 * Each entry in `LLM_READ_TOOLS` is a function from
 * `@bnbagent/studio-runtime/tools` wrapped as a Vercel AI SDK tool. The LLM
 * may call any tool in this set while producing the deliverable (the
 * `notify_funded` work step); the `description` is what the LLM sees.
 *
 * You own this file — edit `LLM_READ_TOOLS` to control exactly what your
 * agent can read on-chain. Entries for features your project doesn't use are
 * commented out by default; uncomment after you've added the dependency to
 * `studio.toml`.
 *
 * **All tools are read-only** by the studio definition: no on-chain state
 * change, no transferable authority, no transaction signing, no EIP-712
 * typed-data signing. The agent IS the sole on-chain signer, but ALL of its
 * signing — quote-sign, submitResult, settle, plus the automatic
 * budget-gated Pieverse LLM-credit auto-renew inside `buildModel()` — lives
 * in `signing.ts` / `model.ts` as FIXED entrypoint code and is NEVER a tool
 * the LLM can invoke. The LLM only produces work text after a job is
 * verified funded; it can never price, sign, spend, or mutate chain state.
 * Keep this set read-only.
 *
 * (`pieverseUsage` is the one exception in the underlying module: it does a
 * SIWE EIP-191 personal_sign, domain-locked to llm.pieverse.io, no on-chain
 * effect. It is commented out below.)

/**
 * The hiring tools, which are the reason this agent is worth renting.
 *
 * They read a catalog, run the deterministic engine in `src/strategy/`, and return the
 * decision together with the reasoning behind it. The model may call them and read the
 * result out loud. It may not choose the listing, move a limit, or recompute an amount.
 * Every number in the result came from `decide()`, which always answers the same way for
 * the same input and is replayed by the backtest.
 *
 * They DECIDE. They do not pay. The descriptions say so, because a model that believes a
 * tool paid somebody will tell a person that somebody was paid.
